# `ZSH-LOG-LINES`

## Introduction

Helpers that I use in my custom scripts, available as both functions (fast) and binaries (slow) when needed.

## Installation

### [Zinit](https://github.com/z-shell/zinit)

Add `zinit load z-shell/zsh-log-lines` to `.zshrc`.
The plugin will be loaded next time you start `Zsh`.
To update issue `zinit update z-shell/zsh-log-lines` from command line.
