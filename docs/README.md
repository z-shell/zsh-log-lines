<h1> Zsh Log Lines </h1>

# Introduction

Helpers that I use in my custom scripts, available as both functions (fast) and binaries (slow) when needed.

# Installation

## [ZI](https://github.com/z-shell/zi)

Add `zi load z-shell/zsh-log-lines` to `.zshrc`.
The plugin will be loaded next time you start `Zsh`.
To update issue `zi update z-shell/zsh-log-lines` from command line.
